## This repository is a collection of various Machine Learning and Data-science-projects implemented by me.

### Folder Structure
Each folder is dedicated to a particular machine learning technique or algorithm. Inside which is the executable.

### How to run
You simple do python <scriptname.py> 
Most of the scripts have inbuilt data or import from a standard library so you need worry about providing data. 

### Requirements
You should have a scientific computing environment installed. I use Anaconda and it works great. You may choose not to install as well and inpdependently install all the dependencies but it can get troublesome later.

Use of virtual environments is hightly recommended.

### License
This part is new for me but you are free to use this code and modify it as you want.

### Source
I learn well from books and dedicated articles rather than videos.
